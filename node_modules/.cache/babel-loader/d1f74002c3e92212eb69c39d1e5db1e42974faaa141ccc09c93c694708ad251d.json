Some people predict the end of employment as we know it, while others insist nothing significant will change. Personally, I believe the reality lies somewhere in between. Work is not disappearing, but it is already being reshaped in ways that are easy to overlook.\n\nFrom Jobs to Tasks\n\nThe real shift is happening at the level of tasks. Repetitive duties such as filing, scheduling, or drafting standard documents are increasingly handled by digital tools. What remains for people are the parts that require judgment, creativity, and communication. Jobs are not being erased overnight, but their composition is changing, and with it, the type of value we contribute.\n\nThe New Shape of Work\n\nI imagine the workplace of tomorrow as leaner and more project-based. Small teams will be able to achieve what once required whole departments. Careers will become less about fixed titles and more about combining tools, data, and human insight into meaningful outcomes. In this landscape, qualities that no machine can replicate—empathy, trust, strategy, and cross-disciplinary thinking—will become even more vital.\n\nChoosing How to Adapt\n\nFor me, the question is not whether work will change, but how we choose to adapt alongside it. If we view new tools only as a threat, we risk falling behind. But if we learn to integrate them into our daily routines—letting them take over what is mechanical while we focus on what is human—then the future of work can become not only more efficient but also more fulfilling.`\n}, {\n  id: \"react-performance-notes\",\n  title: \"The Impact of AI on Software Engineering\",\n  date: \"2025-07-30\",\n  tags: [\"React\", \"Performance\"],\n  excerpt: `A Shift, Not the End\n\nAI is already changing how we code.
