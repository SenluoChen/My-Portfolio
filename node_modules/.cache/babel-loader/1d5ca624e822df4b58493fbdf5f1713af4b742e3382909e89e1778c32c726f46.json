Repetitive duties such as filing, scheduling, or drafting standard documents are increasingly handled by digital tools. What remains for people are the parts that require judgment, creativity, and communication. Jobs are not being erased overnight, but their composition is changing, and with it, the type of value we contribute.\n\nThe New Shape of Work\n\nI imagine the workplace of tomorrow as leaner and more project-based. Small teams will be able to achieve what once required whole departments. Careers will become less about fixed titles and more about combining tools, data, and human insight into meaningful outcomes. In this landscape, qualities that no machine can replicate—empathy, trust, strategy, and cross-disciplinary thinking—will become even more vital.\n\nChoosing How to Adapt\n\nFor me, the question is not whether work will change, but how we choose to adapt alongside it. If we view new tools only as a threat, we risk falling behind. But if we learn to integrate them into our daily routines—letting them take over what is mechanical while we focus on what is human—then the future of work can become not only more efficient but also more fulfilling.`\n}, {\n  id: \"react-performance-notes\",\n  title: \"The Techie’s Reality Check: What AI Really Means for Software Engineering\",\n  date: \"2025-07-30\",\n  tags: [\"React\", \"Performance\"],\n  excerpt: \"一次表單渲染卡頓的救援：Profiler、分段渲染、避免不必要的 re-render。\",\n  content: `A Shift, Not the End\n\nAI is changing how we code.
